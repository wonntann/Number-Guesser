In this exercise, you will create and troubleshoot a new program which has the user input a maximum number range to guess to. After a number range is selected, the user must input a guessed number. The number will be compared to a randomly generated number, then will indicate if the user guessed too high, too low or correctly.


## Step 1
Create a new Python file.


## Step 2
* Import needed libraries
* Use a main function to organize the code
* Create needed variables
* Store the user input for the maximum number to guess up to, incorporate into a while True loop to handle exceptions and incorrect input (hint use [continue](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#break-and-continue-statements-and-else-clauses-on-loops))
* *Optional* Create a time pause in the game using the time module
* Embed a while loop to run during incorrect guesses
* Prompt end user for a number, noting the maximum number that the user input and store the guessed number
* Use conditional statements to compare the guessed number to the computer generated number. Indicate whether the user guessed to high, too low or correctly.


## Step 3
Save and execute the code. You can look at the [solution](#solution.py) after completed or if stuck.


## Tips
* If the program only runs once, incorporate a while loop to have the game continue.
* Use an if, elif, else statement
* Account for an invalid input with a try and except block
