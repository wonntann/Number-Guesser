In this exercise, you will create and troubleshoot a new program that prompts a user to guess a random number within a given range. The number will be compared to a randomly generated number, then will indicate if the user guessed to high, too low or correctly.

## Step 1
Create a new Python file.


## Step 2
* Import needed libraries
* Create needed variables
* Create a random number
* Give user instructions
* Create a loop with a limit on the guesses
* Prompt end user for a number
* Increase the amount of attempts with each guess
* Use conditional statements to compare the guessed number to the computer generated number. Indicate whether the user guessed to high, too low or correctly.
* Have responses for correctly and incorectly guessing


## Step 3
Save and execute the code. You can look at the [solution](#solution.py) after completed or if stuck.


## Troubleshooting
* If the program only runs once, incorporate a while loop to have the game continue.
* Conditional statements: if, elif, else 
* Be mindful of the "control flow" (indentation)
* Acount for an invlid input
