In this exercise, you will create and troubleshoot a new program that prompts a user to guess a random number within a given range. The number will be compared to a randomly generated number, then will indicate if the user guessed to high, too low or correctly.

## Step 1
Create a new Python file.


## Step 2
Prompt end user for a number, then compare the guessed number to the computer generated number. Indicate whether the user guessed to high, too low or correctly.


## Step 3
Save and execute the code.


## Troubleshooting
* If the program only runs once, incorporate a while loop to have the game continue.
* If you Use an if, elif, else statement
* Acount for an invlid input
