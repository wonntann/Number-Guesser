In this exercise, you will create and troubleshoot a new program which has the user input a maximum number range to guess to. After a number range is selected, the user must input a guessed number. The number will be compared to a randomly generated number, then will indicate if the user guessed to high, too low or correctly.

## Step 1
Create a new Python file.


## Step 2
Prompt end user for a maximum number range, next prompt the end user for a number within that range, then compare the guessed number to the computer generated number. Indicate whether the user guessed to high, too low or correctly.


## Step 3
Save and execute the code.


## Troubleshooting
* If the program only runs once, incorporate a while loop to have the game continue.
* If you Use an if, elif, else statement
* Acount for an invlid input
